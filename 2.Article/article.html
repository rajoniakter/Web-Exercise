    Summer is here  and that means it's potluck season.Bring backyard barbecuses, that rooftop soirees and the outdoor dinners.<br>Whenever I'm invite to these events I always want to bring that one dish that wows the other guests.<br>You want to hear people whispering, "What's in this? Who made it? How do I get the recipe?"While they shove another forkful in their mouths.
    </p>

    <p>
        Pasta salad is always a good choice to bring to these types of parties: It can be made ahead of time and tastes better the longer it sits.But there's one problem-it can be boring and flavorless.  
    </p>

    <p>
        But good news: Making a steller pasta salad only takes one simple ingredient you probably already have in back of your fridge ...pickle juice!
    </p>

    <p>
        Using the leftover brine from a jar of pickles isn't a new phenomenon: It's been used to marinate chicken, cure hangovers, add a zing to bloody marys <br> and even relieve cramps in athletes.The juice and spices at the bottom of the jar are a delicious combination of vinegar,garlic,dill,mustard seeds,<br>peppercorns and coriander seeds.It adds a brightness to dishes with a pop of acidity,sourness and tang.Think of it as a one-stop shop falvor.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this recipe, the pickle juice cuts the richness of the mayo in a dill-heavy ranch dressing while adding a briny punch of flavor. The pasta salad also includes perfectly al dente noodles,<br> a good measure of diced pickles, hunks of sharp cheddar cheese, fresh summer tomatoes and of course extra crispy thick-cut bacon.<br> It's basically all of your favorite foods combined into one dish and conveniently called a "salad." 
    </p>

    <p>
        The next time you're looking to be the culinary superstar of the summer,<br>look no further than a jar of pickles. The results will surprise you and your friends.
